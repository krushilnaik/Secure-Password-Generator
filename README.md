# Secure-Password-Generator

A password generator.

The user clicks "Generate Password" and is asked a few questions via alert dialog.

Among the questions are:
1. password length (must still be between 8 and 128 characters)
2. whether to use numbers
3. whether to use capital letters
4. whether to use lowercase letters
5. whether to use special characters (e.g. spaces, colons, semi-colons, question marks, etc.)
